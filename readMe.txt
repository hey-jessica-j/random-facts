I wanted a project to help me pratice using API's and it just grew into my "mid-term". 
I was able to practice and use javascript to create a dynamic webpage that displays a bunch of random quotes 
and facts while randomly creating and adding sytle properties to those divs. 

I learned alot during this project and eel like i got a good understanding of the topics I have been learning. 
On to the next project. 

Also if you have any pointers or ideas of what I could have done differently, another technology I could have used, 
or challenges on what to do next for this project, I'd love to hear them! :)

Things to do next!
1. Make a bakground similar to random stars in the sky but polka dot themed.
